# Tiktok_Comment_Count_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting TikTok video engagement using features such as video description, trending challenges, music information (name, author, duration, ID), and video duration.

Content creators often post without knowing if their video will perform well. A machine learning model that predicts engagement metrics — especially comments — can help creators understand potential performance before publishing content.

Objectives:
●Train machine learning models to predict engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares).
●Collect, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
●Perform feature engineering and text processing on captions and hashtags/challenges.
●Evaluate performance and build a prototype prediction tool.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Streamlit, Google Colab, MS PowerPoint.

Models Used:
●Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
●Random Forest Regressor
●XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, HistGradientBoosting
●Decision Tree
●Stacking Regressor
●Support Vector Machine
LSTM (Deep Learning model for sequence-based prediction)

Evaluation Metrics
●Mean Squared Error (MSE)
●Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
●R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Key Deliverables:
-Trained ML model for comment prediction
-Streamlit web interface for input & prediction
-Detailed project report and presentation
